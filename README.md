# Mapping-Midi-NameNote-Dictionary
#### Author: Bocaletto Luca

This repository provides comprehensive mappings from MIDI note numbers (21–108) to musical note names in English, Italian, and combined English + Italian formats. It serves as a ready-to-use reference for audio applications, MIDI data processing, digital instrument development, and educational tools that need to translate raw MIDI signals into human-readable note names.

## Features

- Complete coverage of the MIDI note range from A0 (21) through C8 (108)  
- Three distinct mappings:
  - English note names (e.g., “C4”, “G#3”)  
  - Italian note names (e.g., “DO4”, “SOL#3”)  
  - Combined English + Italian notation (e.g., “C4 – Do4”)  
- Framework-agnostic: dictionaries can be loaded into any programming environment that supports simple lookups  
- Ideal for:
  - Real-time MIDI visualizers  
  - Music notation software  
  - Educational demonstrations of MIDI to note translation  
  - Testing and prototyping of audio and MIDI tools

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
2. Load the desired mapping dictionary into your application or script.  
3. Use the MIDI note number as the key to retrieve its corresponding note name.  
4. Integrate the mapping into MIDI event handlers, data pipelines, or graphical displays.

No external dependencies are required beyond basic data-structure support in your chosen language.
